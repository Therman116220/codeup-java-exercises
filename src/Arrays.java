/*Arrays Post course  Notes*/
/*
* Arrays are great for code reduction
* Arrays are a bunch of variables smashed together essentually
* Fun Reference- Like a address book, that starts w/  "0"
*MUST DEFINE SIZE - If size will be consistant, and will not change during run-time.

/*NO NEED to define size
* Arraylist is great for less
