import java.util.Arrays;


/*Arrays Post course  Notes*/
/*
* Arrays are great for code reduction
* Arrays are a bunch of variables smashed together essentually
* Fun Reference- Like a address book, that starts w/  "0"
*MUST DEFINE SIZE - If size will be consistant, and will not change during run-time.
*

/*Bounds of Array*/
/*Bounds are the size*/
/*Out of bounds is requestig data from out of index of the array (ex. Asking for 11 with a bounds of 0-10)
*Zero-base index system: Begin indexing at position Zero
*  */


/*    ArrayList  */
/*NO NEED to define size
* Arraylist is great for less
* */






/*Multi-dimentional Arrays*/
